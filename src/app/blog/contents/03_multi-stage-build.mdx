### Multi-Stage Build with Docker

#### Why Use a Multi-Stage Build?

Multi-stage builds in Docker help you create optimized images by separating the build process into multiple stages. This approach has several benefits:

1. **Reduced Image Size:**
   By only including the necessary artifacts in the final image (e.g., your application’s build files), you avoid bloating the image with development tools and dependencies that aren’t needed in production.

2. **Improved Security:**
   By not carrying over unnecessary build tools or source files, you reduce the attack surface of the production image.

3. **Easier Maintenance:**
   Multi-stage builds make Dockerfiles more modular and easier to read and maintain.

4. **Better Performance:**
   Smaller images result in faster deployments and quicker image transfers across environments.

#### Explaining the Code

Here’s a breakdown of the multi-stage Dockerfile you provided:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Installer
FROM node:18-alpine AS installer

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:latest AS deployer

COPY --from=installer /app/build /user/share/nginx/html


```

**Stage 1: Installer**

- **`FROM node:18-alpine AS installer`:**

  - Starts with a lightweight Node.js image.
  - The `AS installer` part names this stage `installer`, which we can reference later.

- **`WORKDIR /app`:**

  - Sets `/app` as the working directory inside the container.

- **`COPY package*.json ./`:**

  - Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (if available) to the working directory.

- **`RUN npm install`:**

  - Installs all dependencies listed in `package.json`.

- **`COPY . .`:**

  - Copies the rest of the application’s source code into the container.

- **`RUN npm run build`:**
  - Runs the build script defined in your `package.json` to generate production-ready files (e.g., static assets).

```dockerfile
# Stage 2: Deployer
FROM nginx:latest AS deployer

COPY --from=installer /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
```

**Stage 2: Deployer**

- **`FROM nginx:latest AS deployer`:**

  - Starts with the latest Nginx image.
  - Names this stage `deployer`.

- **`COPY --from=installer /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html`:**
  - Copies the built application files from the `installer` stage (specifically from `/app/build`) to the default directory served by Nginx (`/usr/share/nginx/html`).

### Why It Works

By using a multi-stage build, we:

1. Keep all the Node.js dependencies and build tools in the `installer` stage, ensuring they don’t end up in the final production image.
2. Copy only the required static files (from `/app/build`) into the lightweight Nginx image in the `deployer` stage, resulting in a smaller and more secure image optimized for serving static content.
