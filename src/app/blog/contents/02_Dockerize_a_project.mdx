### Dockerize a Project

Before this, please install Docker. Here's how you can get started:

- Go to [Play with Docker](https://www.docker.com/play-with-docker/).
- Sign in from [app.docker.com](https://app.docker.com).
- Explore the repository sections in Docker Hub.

For temporary setups, you can use [labs-playdocker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/). Alternatively, you can also download **Docker Desktop**, and its installation process is very easy.

Once installed, open Docker Desktop.

### Steps to Dockerize a Project

1. Clone a repository from the following link:

   ```
   https://github.com/docker/getting-started-app
   ```

2. In the project directory, add a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:

   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:18-alpine

   WORKDIR /app

   # Copying from the current directory to the work directory in the container
   COPY . .

   RUN yarn install --production

   CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]

   EXPOSE 3000
   ```

3. Build the Docker image:

   - Open the terminal and make sure Docker Desktop is running.
   - Run the following command:
     ```shell
     docker build -t todo .
     ```

4. After the build is complete, check the Docker images:

   ```shell
   docker images
   ```

5. Push the image to Docker Hub:

   - First, authenticate using the command:
     ```shell
     docker login
     ```
   - Tag your image using the following command:
     ```shell
     docker tag todo:latest username/test-repo
     ```
     Example:
     ```shell
     docker tag todo:latest idibyaranjan15/test-repo
     ```
   - Push the image to Docker Hub:
     ```shell
     docker push username/test-repo:latest
     ```
     Example:
     ```shell
     docker push idibyaranjan15/test-repo:latest
     ```

6. Pull the image from Docker Hub:

   ```shell
   docker pull username/test-repo:latest
   ```

   Example:

   ```shell
   docker pull idibyaranjan15/test-repo:latest
   ```

7. Run the image:

   ```shell
   docker run -dp 3000:3000 username/test-repo:latest
   ```

   Example:

   ```shell
   docker run -dp 3000:3000 idibyaranjan15/test-repo:latest
   ```

8. To check what is running, use the command:
   ```shell
   docker ps
   ```
